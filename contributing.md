```
go run ./cmd/co --config=./configs/co.yml
go run ./cmd/lo 
go run ./cmd/en
```

#### Configuration
```
GITHUB_TOKEN=
DATABASE_URL=
SITE_ID  = 
NODE_ID  =
RUNTIME = containerd(default), wasm, compose_pkg, helm
DEPLOYMENTS_REPO = https://github.com/edge-orchestration-platform/deployments (this is where co writes deployment requests. lo will monitor for this repo changes for its site)
APPLICATIONS_REPO = https://github.com/edge-orchestration-platform/app-registry (this is for testing. actual repo will be on developers site)
AI_SAMPLE_DEMO = ghcr.io/edge-orchestration-platform/edge-ai-sample(sample edge ai)
```
##### Data Models addition/modifications

go to root directory
add schema files to `ent/schema` and then 

```
ent generate ./ent/schema  --feature sql/upsert
atlas migrate diff add_deloymentstatus --env local --to "ent://ent/schema"
